Handwritten Digit Recognition
Overview
This project uses deep learning to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow and Keras.

Features
Trains a neural network on digit images (0-9).

Uses dropout to prevent overfitting.

Optimized with the Adam optimizer.

Requirements
Install dependencies with:
pip install tensorflow matplotlib
Running the Project
Install dependencies.

Run the script (main.py).

View test accuracy after training.

Future Enhancements
Implement CNNs for improved accuracy.

Apply data augmentation for robustness.
